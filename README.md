# FAQ

1. Why not npins or niv?

My main pain point was the fact that I cannot declaratively specify my dependencies.
I also wanted a nice and quick method of dirty adding deps without pinning and then
running some magic command which would pin with the latest versions.

2. Why C++?

Because it's fast if used correctly, it's the language I know the best
and with enough knowledge is still a viable language for new projects.

3. Rewrite it in *

No.
